# ðŸ¤– AI Lab â€“ Exercises & Notes

Hey guys! ðŸ‘‹  
This repo includes my lab work from the **Artificial Intelligence** course.  I created this repo mostly to help **next yearâ€™s students** (and maybe some lost souls from our ECE crew ).  
If youâ€™re trying to figure out whatâ€™s going on in your labs or just looking for working examples , check it out .

## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Inside

Each lab focuses on a different part of the Python & AI ecosystem. We start simple and go deeper step by step. Every lab comes with different questions to everyone

### ðŸ§© Core Python Libraries
- **NumPy** â†’ numerical computations  
- **Pandas** â†’ data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** & **SciPy** â†’ visualization and interpolation  
- **Seaborn** â†’ data visualization and statistics  
- **Scikit-learn** â†’ classical ML algorithms and preprocessing  

### ðŸ§  AI / ML Libraries (coming in future labs)
- **TensorFlow** â†’ building deep learning models  
- **Keras** â†’ simple and high-level neural networks  
- **PyTorch** â†’ flexible deep learning  
- **OpenCV** â†’ computer vision  
- **LangChain** & **Hugging Face Transformers** â†’ large language models and NLP
