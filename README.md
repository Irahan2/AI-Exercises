## Getting Started
Each lab is self-contained. Navigate to the respective directory and run the Python scripts to see the implementations in action.

```bash
# Example: Running Lab 04 tasks
cd Lab_04
python Task1_Grid.py
python Task2_CNN_Train.py
python Task3_Noise_Eval.py
```

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required packages: `pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn`

# Suggestions

I would recommend you read “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow.” Most of the lab questions and lecture slides are made from this book, and it’s a really useful resource if you want to learn.
