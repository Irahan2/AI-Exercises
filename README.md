# AI Laboratory Exercises

Hey guys! 👋  
This repo includes my lab work from the **Artificial Intelligence** course.  I created this repo mostly to help **next year’s students** (and maybe some lost souls from our ECE crew ).  
If you’re trying to figure out what’s going on in your labs or just looking for working examples , check it out . 
## Lab Structure

### Lab 01 - Data Manipulation & Interpolation
- **Numpy.py**: Array operations and numerical computations
- **Pandas.py**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **interpolation_task.py**: Interpolation methods and curve fitting

### Lab 02 - Linear Regression & Optimization
- **Task1_LinearRegression.py**: Basic linear regression implementation
- **Task2_BGD.py**: Batch Gradient Descent optimization
- **Task3_SGD.py**: Stochastic Gradient Descent
- **Task4_MBGD.py**: Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
- **Task5_Comparison.py**: Performance comparison of optimization methods

### Lab 03 - Classification Algorithms
- **Task_Classification_Models.py**: Implementation of various classification techniques
- **classification_set.csv**: Dataset for classification experiments

### Lab 04 - Deep Learning with CNNs
- **Task1_Grid.py**: MNIST dataset visualization (9×9 grid)
- **Task2_CNN_Train.py**: Convolutional Neural Network training and evaluation
- **Task3_Noise_Eval.py**: Model robustness testing with salt & pepper noise

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Getting Started
Each lab is self-contained. Navigate to the respective directory and run the Python scripts to see the implementations in action.

```bash
# Example: Running Lab 04 tasks
cd Lab_04
python Task1_Grid.py
python Task2_CNN_Train.py
python Task3_Noise_Eval.py
```

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required packages: `pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn`

# Suggestions

I would recommend you read “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow.” Most of the lab questions and lecture slides are made from this book, and it’s a really useful resource if you want to learn.
